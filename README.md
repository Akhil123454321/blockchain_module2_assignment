# Module 2 Assignment
## Part 2
For this part of the assignment, I created an NFT marketplace smart contract. This contract extends the ERC721 standard from OpenZepplin. ERC721 is a standard interface for non-fungible tokens (NFTs) on the Ethereum blockchain. It is a set of rules and functions that define how to create and manage unique, indivisible digital assets on the blockchain.

This smart contract allows the owner to mint new NFTs, set the price for the NFTs, put them up for sale, and buy them. The contract also includes a function for the owner to withdraw funds from the contract.
